# SatMusic
A utility to play music in resource packs based on worldgaurd events.

# Usage
Use a resource pack with custom sounds added.
`testpack` in this repo is a good example. You can take a look at [this resource](https://mcmodels.net/how-to-tutorials/resource-pack-tutorials/how-to-add-custom-sounds-to-resource-pack/)
for more documentation. The song you put inside the config file should be, following the naming conventions in that tutorial, `yoursound:example.sound.name_1`.

# Dependencies
 - [WorldGuardEvents](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/worldguard-events.65176/)
 - Paper 1.18.2+
